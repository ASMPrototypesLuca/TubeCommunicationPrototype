# TubeCommunicationPrototype
This application was created during the workshop "24 ways to communicate". This prototype can be used to translate text into colors as secret encryption.

Inside the zip folder named "Demo", you can find pictures and a short video on how the application works and also previous low level prototypes.

Project documentation is added as well with explanations of the assignment and created prototype.
